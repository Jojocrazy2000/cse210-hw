---- Object Orintated programming Final project ----
This program operates underneath a simple principle. We have plans. Those plans can include classes, events we wish to attend, 
meals we wish to make, or even smaller items like cleaning up our room.

This program will ask you identifying and useful information about the certain plan and remembers it. Follow the instructions in 
the terminal and you will be able to added your plans into this program.

Eventually you will be able to save the plans into a format so that you can either change them out or even share them with others.
The main benifit from using the student life planner is that now you can have all the plans listed in one place instead of it
being across two or three programs.
